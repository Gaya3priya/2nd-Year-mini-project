## Description:

The society today is dependent on information technology and with the help of technology makes it easier to access information.The purpose of a password is to protect sensitive and important data from unauthorized users who intentionally or accidentally access the system. To prevent unauthorized access it is important to have a strong and tamper proof password. A good password should be easy to remember, hard to guess by others and be difficult to predict by a person or software. We are trying to make a Password Strength Estimator by analyzing and calculating how much time a hacker takes to crack a user's password. Based on that the user can understand how strong their password is. 

## Requirements:
1. python==3.9.4

2. Django==3.2.4
